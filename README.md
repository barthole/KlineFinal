This program was produced over the span of 36 hours. I spent about 12 hours editing and polishing the program so it would not break immediately if the user did not follow the program exactly. Main motivation for this program came from a desire to create something practical that anyone cane use. A calculator meets all of these requirements but was also challenging enough to create. At this point I'm happy enough with the program for the time I had to create it and the headaches it gave me.
